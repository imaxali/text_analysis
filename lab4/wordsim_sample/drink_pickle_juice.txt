Everything you need to know about pickle juice
People have considered pickles to be a health food for centuries, and some claim that pickle juice has its own benefits. What does the research say?

Many people believe that drinking pickle juice is good for the body. Some claim, for example, that it might enhance exercise performance or help control blood sugar.

However, it is very high in sodium.

In this article, we look at the research behind the health effects of pickles and pickle juice.


What is pickle juice?
According to the New York Food Museum, records of pickles date back to 2030 B.C., when travelers from India helped start a custom of preserving cucumbers in the Tigris Valley.

Pickling cucumbers requires three main ingredients: cucumbers, salt, and water.

Lactobacillus bacteria, which normally cover the vegetableâ€™s skin, can ferment the cucumber. However, commercial manufacturers usually remove these beneficial probiotic bacteria during processing and add vinegar instead.

After several weeks of curing, the cucumbers have transformed into pickles and are ready to eat. The juice is what surrounds the pickles in the jar.

Bottom line: Pickling is a simple way to preserve cucumbers and other foods, using salt, water, and sometimes vinegar.


Side effects
While it could have some health benefits, pickle juice is not for everyone.

Here are some factors to consider before adding it to the diet:

High sodium: Too much salt can lead to water retention, swelling, and bloating.
Raised blood pressure: Water retention from eating large amounts of salt can increase blood pressure.
Indigestion: Drinking too much pickle juice can lead to gas, stomach pain, and diarrhea.
Cramping: Some doctors worry that drinking pickle juice may actually cause electrolyte imbalances and worsen cramping. However, studies do not support this.
Bottom line: Drinking pickle juice is generally safe, though it may be a good idea to discuss the risks with a doctor before trying it.


Summary
Research indicates that pickle juice may help soothe cramps and keep blood sugar levels in check.

However, there is no evidence that these advantages are exclusive to pickle juice. Juice from a jar of olives or pickled peppers, for example, may provide the same health benefits.

Regarding other health claims about pickle juice, the evidence is anecdotal at best.

Anyone who wishes to try pickle juice can drink it from a jar of pickles or buy the juice online.om line: Pickle juice that contains vinegar may help limit a rise in blood sugar after eating.
