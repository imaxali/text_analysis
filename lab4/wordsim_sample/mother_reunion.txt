Baby girl reunited with mother after car was stolen while she was inside it
Peoria Police confirmed a baby girl is safe after a vehicle was stolen while she was inside it.

Police said the incident started near Frye and California. A grey Dodge Charger was left running momentarily and stolen. The baby's mother is the one who called police.

Police in the area said they saw the car driving south down Monroe. Police tried to stop the Charger, but the driver kept going.

The car was eventually found abandoned in the 1000 block of NE Madison without the baby inside.

Police started canvassing the area, and using K9's to search for the 11-month-old baby girl. They also issued a Code Red, alerting the neighborhood about the situation. It did not take long for police to find a suspect nearby in Morton Square Park. The juvenile boy was taken into custody.

About two hours after the initial incident, police got a tip about a child left in an alley in the 2600 block of Prospect Rd.

It was the baby from the Dodge Charger. She was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, but police said she appeared to be fine by her appearance. She's been reunited with her mother.

Police believe more than one person was involved in this. They're asking anyone with information to call them at 309-673-4521.
