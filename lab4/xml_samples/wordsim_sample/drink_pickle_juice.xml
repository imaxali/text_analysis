    <block>What is pickle juice?</block>
    <block>According to the New York Food Museum, records of pickles date back to 2030 B.C., when travelers from India helped start a custom of preserving cucumbers in the Tigris Valley.</block>
    <block>Pickling cucumbers requires three main ingredients: cucumbers, salt, and water.</block>
    <block>Lactobacillus bacteria, which normally cover the vegetableâ€™s skin, can ferment the cucumber. However, commercial manufacturers usually remove these beneficial probiotic bacteria during processing and add vinegar instead.</block>
    <block>After several weeks of curing, the cucumbers have transformed into pickles and are ready to eat. The juice is what surrounds the pickles in the jar.</block>
    <block>Bottom line: Pickling is a simple way to preserve cucumbers and other foods, using salt, water, and sometimes vinegar.</block>

    <block>Indigestion: Drinking too much pickle juice can lead to gas, stomach pain, and diarrhea.</block>
    <block>Cramping: Some doctors worry that drinking pickle juice may actually cause electrolyte imbalances and worsen cramping. However, studies do not support this.</block>
    <block>Bottom line: Drinking pickle juice is generally safe, though it may be a good idea to discuss the risks with a doctor before trying it.</block>
